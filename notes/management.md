# Management

What is the level of creativity and self expression desire in management?

I think that management for the most part, since it is a people based skill, always needs to fall on the side of calculated risk. Management is an inherently conservative profession, that slowly pushes the boundaries, as it deals with people and people are generally resistant to change.

Managment must balance change to the organization required for continual renewal with the stability of the organization.

Too much change too fast causes organizations to disintegrate as the bonds between people become strained.
