# Computer Science Culture Discussions

The following papers are meant to start discussions about topics in Computer Science.

# Procedure

Give each student a copy of the choosen paper and give them a week to read it. Possibly giving it out on Friday and discussing the paper the following Friday.

Each student should answer the following questions independently.

Potentially the students could write up their responses on an online post board. After they post they could then read other students responses.

## Questions

1. What questions do you have?
2. What did you learn?
3. How do the topics discussed apply to your life?
