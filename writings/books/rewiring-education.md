Rewiring Education - John D. Couch


The ideal student teacher ratio is 1:1 but this is not scalable.



logic an visualization

problem solving

mental bicycle

learning all the time

concept of digital natives


Can not replace the educational system, too expensive
can't repair parts, have to reinvision the system as a whole

There is not one best way, there are many ways that work, some better than others

imposition of artificial time lines

students of all ages

zone of proximal development

people jump to assumptions about students due to pattern matching, have to keep an open mind and believe that every child can succeed

beware of confirmation bias 

believe that every student has the potential to succeed

potential for what, success is individual for the student

standard pace for a course leaves students behind and does not allow others to go ahead

measure growth, why should all students achieve the same thing at the same point in time? People are different

highe expectations for all students

don't think about realistic, it limits

not everyone is born equal. that's ok, technology as an educationa equalizer


children aso need emotional support

need for connection

need for competence
