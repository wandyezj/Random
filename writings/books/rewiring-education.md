# Rewiring Education

Rewiring Education - John D. Couch


The ideal student teacher ratio is 1:1 but this is not scalable.



logic an visualization

problem solving

mental bicycle

learning all the time

concept of digital natives


Can not replace the educational system, too expensive
can't repair parts, have to reinvision the system as a whole

There is not one best way, there are many ways that work, some better than others

imposition of artificial time lines

students of all ages

zone of proximal development

people jump to assumptions about students due to pattern matching, have to keep an open mind and believe that every child can succeed

beware of confirmation bias 

believe that every student has the potential to succeed

potential for what, success is individual for the student

standard pace for a course leaves students behind and does not allow others to go ahead

measure growth, why should all students achieve the same thing at the same point in time? People are different

highe expectations for all students

don't think about realistic, it limits

not everyone is born equal. that's ok, technology as an educationa equalizer


children aso need emotional support

need for connection

need for competence



Motivation

Self determination Theory
motivation is a prerequisite for effective learning

self detemination - choice
intrinsic motivation is bettern than extrinsic motivation

Choice

expectations students can live to - have high expectations and enable students to reach them

Learn to live with failure - deliberate practice

Grit - perservere in the face of adversity

Content must be relatable, tailor learning to each student

Is it possible to have each student relate their learning to their own life and for them to do the work to make learning relatable?

Collaborative - it's easiest if students can explain things to each other

Spaces

campfire - one to many, experts to multiple learners
watering hole - many to many, people com together to share and collaborate promote and share diversity of thoughts 
cave - one to one learning. learn by self, desk by itself, actively reflect
mountaintop -independent learning, obtain own feedback, independent project


watering hole

* share independent findings
* discover and explore as a group
* elicit feedback
* become learners and teachers
* make good use of technology

Challenges

Challenge based Learning

learn as a classroom

project based learning - turn lessons into projectd


Big Idea

help students make the idea more manageable

* How might we do this particular thing?
* What might the obstacles be and how might we get around them?
* How will all of this actually work?
* How can we make a difference in society?

Every current in the stream matters, how will you current help alter the flow of history?


All Educational frameworks should map to standards

Teachers can find creative ways to teach any set of standards

Students should actually make a difference in their communities

Access

Training and support go with technology

It's not enough to simply introduce technology without the appropriate socialization of usage to go along with it

When technology or any change is introduced it needs to be well thought through and successful otherwise people become disillusioned with the change.

Online Learning

Online learning can't simply be a move of the lecture online the entire course and infrastructure needs to support this mode of learning

Need to deliver a complete end to end experience not just individual pieces

Build

What should students do with the access to technology?

Elimination of grades

present a problem first and learn from there

learning to use verses learning about

Maker Movement

Empower sense of autonomy, do what they want verses what they are told, which can increase motivation to learn

Open Worlds verses closed worlds


The role of the teacher is to create the conditions for innovation rather than provide ready made knowledge

measure progress, individuals against themselves verses people against people since everyone learns at different rates

knowledge is less important that motivation, with motivation knowledge can be obtained

ideal teacher student ratio is 1:1 but this is not financially feasible, so we must be creative and find a ways to allow similar experiences with a single teacher

How to think about students:

* who are they?
* what are they capable of?
* what can we do to help?

progress and master based assessments that are available at any time

more options on how to learn

if wikipedia can answer a question on a test, then it probably isn't a question worth asking

receiving student input during the class

teachers must help students relate the content to their students context

* Why do I need to now this material?
* why does it matter?

many ways to experience the same material and gain additional skills and ideas

"digital natives" technology isn't just a tool but a part of the environment, embracing weiser's vision of ubiquitous computing

issuing every student a computer that is district managed
