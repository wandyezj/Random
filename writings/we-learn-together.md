# We Learn Together

Everyone is always learning.

People learn at different rates and build up different experiences in different areas over time.

Generally people can exchange knowledge and learn from each others experiences.


How to facilitate effective knowledge sharing?

Sharing knowledge and teaching others is a distinct skill set from having the knowledge in the first place.


Developing knowledge and spreading knowledge are two distinct skills.

Where does knowledge live?

Knowledge lives formost in the physical world or the source of truth.

Distilling meaning from observation. The general, widly applicable, from the specific, narrowly applicable.

Knowledge about the world can be obtained by individuals or processes and captured in physical media.

Physical Media includes: pictures, writing, sound recordings, videos etc... 

In turn physical media can be used to create media used to teach others about this knowledge.

How to develop knowledge?

Development of original knowledge

* Experience
* Testing
* Synthesis of different pieces of knowledge


How to spread knowledge?

* Learning Material
* Individuals train themselves
* Train individuals
* Consolidate knowledge in process, and have people follow the process
    * Societal institutions are an example of knowledge capture
    * Cultures are another mechanism of knowlede capture, when someone joins the culture they become accustomed to the practices of the dominant culture


Thus people always


People have learned different things
