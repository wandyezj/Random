# Communicating Educational Goals

I was talking to a public high school student recently and I asked them what was the purpose of school. They answered that the purpose of school was to get into college so they could get a job.

The was unsatisfied with this response as I believe there are more important goals to public education.

I think that this conversation potentially points to a gap in communication between Admnistrators, Teachers and Students.

Similarly there is potentially confusion in wider society about the purpose of a public education.

What can be done to define specific high level educational principles and communicate them appropriately to each level?

Educational principals should be thought of as high level Axioms from which all further educationa goals are derived. In turn these smaller goals drive specific actions to accomplish these goals.

> Why should students go to school?

> Do students care about any of these reasons?

> Why should students care about accomplishing these goals?

> how can these goals be effectively communicated to students?

Knowledge extraction and propogation

## Establishing Educational Goals

Part of the issue seems to be that there is not one set of clear educational goals, although there are many common themes.

Lack of Clarity on what the purpose of public education should be.
