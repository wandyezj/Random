# Defining Purpose

Where to focus effort.

Defining desire.

In some ways purpose is the only thing that matters.

Being able to define someones purpose and being able to channel someones purpose through desired channels.

In general purpose can be thought of as some sort of goal, some outcome that one desires to achieve.

Inspiration is the action that translates someone from being purpouseless to purposeful or to gain a new purpose alongside others.

Parallel to inspiration is channeling purpose. How does someone purpose get channeled into actions?

Purpose without some sort of outlet for relief, would possible be frustrating? Frustration is possibly a negative state to be in.

What inspires people?

How can purpose be channeled?

I suppose these thoughts could be taken in a sort of negative light as "manipulating people" but that's really not what it's about. It's understanding ones self, manipulating ones self, uncovering ones own defined purposes, understanding how those purposes are channeled into ones own actions in life, and most fundamenatlly understanding the various influences that lead to ones own purposes and understanding the channels one is pursuing.

Understanding purpose is about understanding oneself so one can better understand the choices one is making.

Purposes generally do not exist alone, often there are many competing purposes that are all pursued simultaneously.

Additionally many purposes abstract or are composed of other purposes. 

This web of pruposes of course seems confusing, and it is confusing! Most people are constantly bombarded with new purposes and new thoughts and ways to achieve them. It's possible that an inspiration spawned a purpose and is currently being channeled when perhapse on reflection that purposes behind that spawned purpose are no longer relevant.

An interesting example of ephemeral purposes being channeled and discarded is in the persuit of fads.
