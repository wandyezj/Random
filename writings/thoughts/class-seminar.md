# Class Seminar

Implementing the "We Learn Together" philosophy.

## Abstract

Unlike a normal class where the instructor instructs and students learn, a Seminar is an open dialog between students facilitated by the instructor.

The concept is a class where the goal is to combine both facilitator content and student generated content so that students learn both from the facilitator and each other.

The role of the facilitator is to provide direction and facilitate student learning.

## Goals

As with any class, a seminar should have specific learning outcomes set by the facilitator that each student is assessed on.

The Seminar facilitator is in charge of setting learning outcomes and ensuring that students achieve those learning outcomes.

Due to a Seminars more interactive and student participative nature, students are encouraged to assist and help other students achieve the specified learning outcomes.

Learning outcomes might include:

* specific knowledge
* specific skills

Per usual, specification of learning outcomes should be clear and transparent to students. Clear outcomes encourage student self assessment so they know what they need to learn and so they know when to get help.

Learning outcomes set a baseline for all students and set a direction for the class. The facilitator should encourage students to go above and beyond the baseline: to explore areas that interest them, and to share their findings with the rest of the class so that everyone can advance their skills and knowledge.

## Assessment

Student assessment of learning outcomes can be done in any of the standard ways.

* Quiz
* Test
* Small Project
* Small Paper

Per usual, students should be assessed on their achievement of learning objectives at the end of the class. What matters is what students were able to take away, not how long it took them to get there. (note: the final assessment is time boxed to the end of the class in most institutions)

## Possible Seminar Structure

In general individual learning should take place outside of the classroom.

* Lectures can be recorded to be viewed outside of class. Ideally lectures are broken into 5-10 minute segments as research has shown this is generally the longest amount of time most people can concentrate on a lecture.
* Required reading can be done outside of class. Required reading assignments should come with a list of questions to answer so students can self assess that they understand the key points of the paper. This can be followed up with an in class discussion of those key points.

Classroom time should be used for student to student interaction, such as discussions or interaction between the facilitator and students. Interactive exercises have been consistently shown to be one of the most effective learning activities.

## Encouraging Independent and Cooperative Learning

Term Project and Project Presentation

The Term Project encourages students to deeply explore an aspect of the class. The Term Presentation encourages students to concisely share what they have learned with everyone in class.

The Project can be anything that helps the student learn more and expand upon the class material. The goal of the Project is to help students learn how to learn independently and to have them learn from their fellow students. That said, the facilitator should provide clear guidelines on what is expected and guidance / recommendations on how to go about the project. Facilitator guidance is extremely valuable, as most students will not have the facilitators familiarity with the classes domain.

Some Project possibilities are a paper or prototype. Throughout the course the student should progress through the following stages and receive feedback early and often from their fellow students and the class facilitator. All due dates should be the same for all students, as this is substantially easier to manage and it is much fairer to all students.

* Idea
* Research
* Outline
* Draft
* Final
* Presentation Draft
* Presentation Final

At all stages of the Project students should be expected to give feedback to their fellow students (ideally the facilitator provides guidance on what makes good feedback) this encourages students to engage with other students ideas and thus with the course material as well as provides feedback on their own project.

## Course Management

Follow standard course management practices. These days most courses use a Learning Management System to distribute and keep track of material and to facilitate discussion of material outside of class between students and between students and the facilitator.

In general to avoid complication, it's best to follow whatever practices the institutions is using so students do not need to waste time learning a new system. Learning a new system generally does not add much value to the course and is a tax on student learning and class time.
