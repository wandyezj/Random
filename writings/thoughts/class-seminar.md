# Class Seminar

Implementing the "We Learn Together" philosophy.

## Abstract

Unlike a normal class where the instructor instructs and students learn, a Seminar is an open dialog between students facilitated by the instructor.

The concept is a class where the goal is to combine both facilitator content and student generated content so that students learn both from the facilitator and each other.

The role of the facilitator is to provide direction for discussion and student learning.

## Goals

As with any class a seminar should have specific learning outcomes set by the facilitator that each student is assessed on.

The Seminar facilitator is in charge of setting learning outcomes and ensuring that students achieve those learning outcomes.

Due to a Seminars more interactive and student participative nature students are encouraged to assist and help other students achieve the learning outcomes.

Learning outcomes might include:

* specific knowledge
* specific skills

Per usual specification of learning outcomes should be clear and transparent to students so that they can self assess that they have achieve the learning outcomes and get help if required.


Learning outcomes set a baseline for all students and set a direction for the class. The facilitator should encourage students to go above and beyond the baseline, o explore areas that interest them, and to share their findings with the rest of the class so that everyone can
