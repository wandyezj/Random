# API Design

## Abstract

What is an Application Programming Interface (API)?

> 

What is the purpose of an API?

> An APIs purpose is to make knowledge accessible.

What is knowledge in the context of an API?

> Knowledge in the context of an API 

What is accessible knowledge?

> Knowledge that is accessible is discoverable and usable by others with minimal effort.

What is a reasonable process to follow to develop an API?

> This paper will attempt to answer that question.

## Defining Purpose


## Defining Context

How is the knowledge to be communicated defined?

## Process for Fulfilling Purpose 

tricky since party an API is a form of communication.
