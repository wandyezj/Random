# API Design

## Abstract

What is an Application Programming Interface (API)?

> An API is "a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components" per [Wikipedia's article on Application Programming Interface][API Wikipedia].

> "An  API  is  the  interface  to  implemented  functionality  that  developers  can  access  to  perform various  tasks." per [What makes APIs Hard to learn? Answers from Developers][What makes APIs Hard to learn? Answers from Developers]

What is the purpose of an API?

> The purpose of an API is to make knowledge accessible.

What is knowledge in the context of an API?

> Knowledge in the context of an API is functionality to perform programming tasks.

What is accessible knowledge?

> Knowledge that is accessible is discoverable and usable by others with minimal effort.

What is a reasonable process to follow to develop an API?

What are some considerations when developing an API?

> This paper will attempt to answer that question.

## Paper Structure

An Application Programming Interface (API) is ultimately a way to access functionality. A key piece of accessing functionality is ease of use: being able to quickly discover, understand, and apply the provided functionality. This paper will examine considerations for how to design an API with ease of use in mind.

This paper will look at ease of use considerations of four API aspects

* [Model](#model),
* [Behavior](#behavior),
* [Structure](#structure), and,
* [Documentation](#documentation).

Each API aspect will explore its Purpose, Principals, and Patterns.

What is each?

## Importance

A well designed API can significantly reduce the life-cycle cost of software. A Poorly designed API can significantly increase the life-cycle cost of software.

Reasons Why:

## Behavior

### API Definition

[API Wikipedia]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface
[API Wikipedia][API Wikipedia]

```
an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.
```

* Successful Public APIs capture customers
* Bad APIs result in support calls
* Public APIs are forever
* Thinking in terms of APIs improves code quality

* Poor APIs are difficult to program with and often require additional code to be written
* poor APIs are harder to understand and more difficult to work with than good ones
* Poor APIs often require not only extra code, but also more complex code that provides more places where bugs can hide

* Poor APIs Increase the cost to develop software
    * Time to Understand
    * Time to Write
    * Time to test
    * Time to fix bugs

* Poor APIs cost everyone time.

    "efforts to improve the us-ability of an API’s structure need to be complemented  by  efforts  to  improve  the  resources  available to learn them"
* API Documentation Must
    * include good examples
    * be complete
    * support many complex usage scenarios
    * be conveniently organized
    * include relevant design elements
* Understanding Design Aspects and Rationale
    * Understanding APIs high level design
* Working with Code Examples
    * snippets - basic API functionality
    * tutorials - complete application
    * applications - samples, and open source projects
