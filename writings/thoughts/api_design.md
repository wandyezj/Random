What is the purpose of an API?

> The purpose of an API is to make knowledge accessible.

What is knowledge in the context of an API?

> Knowledge in the context of an API is functionality to perform programming tasks.

What is accessible knowledge?

> Knowledge that is accessible is discoverable and usable by others with minimal effort.

## Paper Structure

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a way to access functionality. One consideration of accessing functionality is ease of use: being able to quickly discover, understand, and apply the provided functionality. This paper will examine considerations for designing an accessible API.

This paper will look at ease of use in four API aspects:

* [Model](#model),
* [Behavior](#behavior),
* [Structure](#structure), and,
* [Documentation](#documentation).

Each API aspect will explore its __Purpose__, and three related __Principals__:

* __Purpose__ is what role the API aspect serves in design,
* __Principals__ are high level direction towards accessible design considerations.

The API Aspects and explored principals are:

* Model
    * Reduce complexity
    * Reuse existing models
    * Recycle 
* Behavior
    * positive
    * predictable
    * concise
    * conventional
    * consistent
* Structure
    * form follows function 
    * constrain - strong types
    * names
    * parameters
* Documentation
    * Projects
    * IntelliSense
    * Examples

consistent
constrained

The end of the paper is a [reference section](#reference) that summarizes papers that sparked this one.

## Aspects

### Model

The model of an API is it's underlying paradigm. The model consists of both a __Technical Model__ and __Mental Model__.

The __Technical Model__ is how the API is implemented and imposes constraints on design. In general the __Technical Model__ is usually a well known paradigm.

Some well known __Technical Models__ include:

* [Instruction Set Architectures](#Instruction-Set-Architectures) such as x86, AMD64, and ARM
* [Relational Model](#Relational-Algebra-Model) that backs most modern databases.
* [Hypertext Transfer Protocol](#Hypertext-Transfer-Protocol)
* Language Models: C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Block programming etc...
    * Languages generally provide specific means to accomplish various programming tasks and generally come with a standard set of conventions.

The __Technical Model__ provides the foundation for which an API is based and comes with a certain set of expectations about how features in the model are used.

The __Mental Model__ is the users map of what that API represent and how that API pieces fit together to accomplish tasks. See [The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman](#The-Design-of-Everyday-Things-by-Don-Norman) chapter 1 for a good explanation of mental models.

#### Model Purpose

The purpose of the __Technical Model__ is to ground the API in a technical implementation. The __Technical Model__ constrains the APIs implementation and how it is exposed.

The purpose of the __Mental Model__ is to provide an overall model for what the API represents and how it can be interacted with.

Together the __Technical Model__ and __Mental Model__ provide the platform on which to build the API.

#### Model Principals

* Prefer Recycling existing Models when possible.
* Prefer simpler models.
* Prefer declarative over imperative. What over How

In general it's better if the __Mental Model__ and __Technical Model__ are already known to users as this significantly reduces the amount of learning a user needs to to to be able to use the API. If using an existing model it's best to follow the model as closely as possible since any deviation can surprise users and lead to mistakes in code.

Simpler is generally easier to understand, making the __Mental Model__ and __Technical Model__ have as few steps or pieces as possible will generally make it easier to grasp.


### Behavior

The behavior of an API includes all the effects that it has. API behavior includes both success and error cases.

What can it do and what should it be allowed to do?

#### Behavior Purpose

The purpose of an APIs behavior is to accomplish its assigned task and provide feedback on that tasks status and the current state of the model.

The APIs behavior is a description of what it should do (the positive description) and what it should __not__ do (the negative description).

#### Behavior Principals

* Positive description
* succinctly explainable
* 

Prefer the positive description. The positive description is what the API should do, the API should only do what is described and nothing more.
The negative description of what an API should __not__ do is infinite, the positive description is constrained to what is described.

When describing behavior prefer succinct explainable behavior. Every additional special case or feature adds to mental overhead which makes things harder to understand.

Error handling is part of an APIs behavior. Make sure to describe what happens in an error case.

Have one model for error handling, avoid mixing patterns. Error cases are generally an afterthought when writing code. Having a single way of handling errors makes this easier on developers.

Prefer allowing the behavior to understand the current state of the system after an action occurs when possible. This allows the API user to experiment with the system.


### Structure

The structure of an API is the interface for interaction. The structure is based in the __Technical Model__ and can help shape the desired __Mental Model__ for the user. The structure is usually made of the methods, classes, and interfaces available to the user but the specifics are dependent on the __Technical Model__.

#### Structure Purpose

The purpose of API structure is to provide the concrete blocks of interaction the user can access. The structure contributes towards representing allowed behavior and shaping the users __Mental Model__ of the API. The structure also contributes towards the readability of the final sequence of interaction blocks.

#### Structure Principals

* Prefer strongly types structures
* Prefer one method of error handling

* Having the same structure represent the same concept is easier to understand and remember.


* Choose one method of error handling. Avoid mixing error handling structures: return codes, exceptions etc..
* Strong Types
* Avoid overloading operators with operations that are not mainstream on those object types.

### Documentation

Documentation explains to the user how to effectively interact with the API. Documentation can 

Making sure it works well and is accessible from a development environment

How the programmer types out an action

Documentation can exist on multiple levels:

* Mental Model
* Specific Calls
* Parameters
* Performance Limitations
* Interactions between APIs

#### Documentation Purpose

The purpose of documentation is to explain how to effectively interact with the API.

#### Documentation Principals

* Paradigm Documentation
* Examples
* Applications
* Tutorials

## Conclusion

* keep it simple
* keep it known
* keep it explainable

## Content

How is the knowledge to be communicated defined?

```text
an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.

* Poor APIs Increase the cost to develop software
    * Time to Understand
    * Time to Write
    * Time to test
    * Time to fix bugs
* Poor APIs cost everyone time.

> usable  APIs are  more  intuitive,  require  less  documentation  browsing,  and encourage reuse, thus increasing developers’ productivity

> cognitive dimensions: elements that characterize the expectations of users and what an API actually provides


> Finding descriptive, non-ambiguous names for API features is problematic given that programmers may be used to different terminologies.

> Discovering relations between API types (classes)  requires significant effort; simple designs are  beneficial,especially to less experienced programmers.

> Accurate and complete documentation is a crucial issue for API usability; all the major usability flaws discovered in our study trace back to unsatisfactory documentation.

> Flexibility is a double-edged sword in API design: experienced programmers can take advantage of it, but it may confuse those with less practice

usability tokens - tokens are negatives in the API design

* surprise - api performs in a way that is not as the developer expected
* choice - requires understanding options slowing implementation
* missed - feature was there to aid implementation but developer did not see it
* incorrect - developer uses API incorrectly
* unexpected - API used in way not designed for
