# Opportunity for Formal Methods

embracing the future of critical systems in industry.

Why Now:

* Safety

* critical infrastructure is being handed over to computers and software
* IOT -
* Protocol specification
* military systems
* securing public infrastructure against bad actors or programs gone rogue

no one wants their toaster to burn their house down
* can't afford to be held hostage by your toaster- by either bad actors or poor programming

Formal Methods use cases:

How can it be used pracically in industry?

* deep specification of programs and algorithms - without implementation
    * both hardware and software
    * enable open source implementation
* ensuring that programs have required properties
* ensuring that code conforms to standards - enforce government regulations - specification adherence test

Allow government and industry to enforce requirements.

Reducing cost

* Standardize
* Tooling
* Education

* Developing a learning community in industry and academia

Rollout

* meeting developers where they are now
* allow addition to existing systems
* allow rewrite of small components
* allow verification of some assumptions of components


As the tools prove useful there will be increased investment in making things easier and it will be applied to more things.

Value

How can I use this in practically in industry 

What can be proved about programs?

another type of testing


* Refactoring

## Education Concepts

developing education

* build learing community
* delegate work to students as part of class
* content development
* short small assignments

Proofs

Operations:

* intro
* induction
* reflexivity
* simplify
* apply
* substitute

Techniques:

* show one version of a program has equivalent output as another program
* invarients
