## Abstract

What is an Application Programming Interface (API)?

> An API is "a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components" per [Wikipedia's article on Application Programming Interface][API Wikipedia].

> "An API is the interface to implemented functionality that developers can access to perform various tasks." per [What makes APIs Hard to learn? Answers from Developers][What makes APIs Hard to learn? Answers from Developers]

What is the purpose of an API?

> The purpose of an API is to make knowledge accessible.

What is knowledge in the context of an API?

> Knowledge in the context of an API is functionality to perform programming tasks.

What is accessible knowledge?

> Knowledge that is accessible is discoverable and usable by others with minimal effort.

## Paper Structure

An Application Programming Interface (API) is a way to access functionality. One consideration of accessing functionality is ease of use: being able to quickly discover, understand, and apply the provided functionality. This paper will examine considerations for designing an accessible API.

This paper will examine accessibility Principles in four API aspects:

* [Model](#model),
* [Behavior](#behavior),
* [Structure](#structure), and,
* [Documentation](#documentation).

Each API aspect will describe itself, then explore its __Purpose__, and two related __Principles__:

* __Purpose__ is what role the API aspect serves in design,
* __Principles__ are high level direction towards accessible design considerations.

The API Aspects and explored Principles are:

* [Model](#model)
    * [Employ Existing](#employ-existing)
    * [Minimal](#minimal)
* [Behavior](#behavior)
    * [Positive](#positive)
    * [Concise](#concise)
* [Structure](#structure)
    * [Form Follows Function](#form-follows-function)
    * [Constrain Use](#constrain-use)
* [Documentation](#documentation)
    * [Explain Concepts](#explain-concepts)
    * [Show Intent](#show-intent)

The paper concludes with a summary of the principles and a [reference section](#reference) of material which guided this topic.

References have hyperlinks for easy access, and summaries of key takeaways that guided the construction of the principles. Every reader is encouraged to read all reference material for more details.

## Aspects

### Model

The model of an API is its underlying paradigm. The model consists of both a __Technical Model__ and __Mental Model__.

The __Technical Model__ is how the API is implemented and imposes constraints on design.

Some well known __Technical Models__ include:

* [Instruction Set Architectures](#Instruction-Set-Architectures) such as: x86, AMD64, and ARM.
* [Relational Model](#Relational-Algebra-Model) that backs many modern databases.
* [Hypertext Transfer Protocol](#Hypertext-Transfer-Protocol)
* Language Models: C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, Block programming etc...
    * Languages generally provide specific means to accomplish various programming tasks and generally come with a standard set of conventions.

The __Technical Model__ provides the foundation for which an API is based and comes with a certain set of expectations about how features in the model are used.

The __Mental Model__ is the user's map of what API represents, and how the API pieces fit together to accomplish tasks. See [The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman](#The-Design-of-Everyday-Things-by-Don-Norman) chapter 1 for a good explanation of mental models.

#### Model Purpose

The purpose of the __Technical Model__ is to ground the API in a technical implementation. The __Technical Model__ constrains the APIs implementation and how it is exposed.

The purpose of the __Mental Model__ is to provide an overall model for what the API represents and how it can be interacted with.

Together the __Technical Model__ and __Mental Model__ provide the platform on which to build the API.

#### Model Principles

##### Employ Existing

Employing a known __Mental Model__ and __Technical Model__  significantly reduces the amount of learning required to be able to use the API. When using an existing model it's best to follow the model as closely as possible since any deviation can surprise users and lead to mistakes in code.

##### Minimal

Fewer concepts generally takes less time to understand. Employing a __Mental Model__ and __Technical Model__ have as few steps or pieces as possible will generally make it easier to grasp.

### Behavior

The behavior of an API includes all the effects that it has. API behavior includes both success and error cases.

What can it do and what should it be allowed to do?

#### Behavior Purpose

The purpose of an API's behavior is to accomplish its assigned task and provide feedback on that task's status and the current state of the model.

The API's behavior is a description of what it __should__ do (the positive description) and what it should __not__ do (the negative description).

#### Behavior Principles

##### Positive

The positive description is what the API should do. The API should only do what is described and nothing more.

The negative description of what an API should __not__ do is infinite. The positive description is constrained to what is described.

Using the positive descriptions for an API's behavior is more descriptive than the negative description.

Positive descriptions are easier to understand than a combination of positive and negative descriptions.

##### Concise

Succinct explainable behavior is easier to understand than more complex behavior. Every additional special case or feature adds to mental overhead which makes things harder to understand.

### Structure

The structure of an API is the interface for interaction. The structure is based in the __Technical Model__ and can help shape the desired __Mental Model__ for the user. The structure specifics are dependent on the __Technical Model__, but usually consists of the methods, classes, and interfaces available to the user.

#### Structure Purpose

The purpose of API structure is to provide the concrete blocks of interaction the user can access. The structure suggests allowed behavior, shapes the user's __Mental Model__ of the API, and enhances the readability of the final sequence of interaction blocks.

#### Structure Principles

##### Form Follows Function

The form of the API should represent its function. Having the same structure represent the same concept is easier to understand and remember.

Making the elements of the API (i.e. names, types, functions, and parameters) describe the encapsulated behavior helps developers identify the correct API to use. For example, a function that performs a matrix transpose is better called `matrix_transpose()`, and not `foo()`.

##### Constrain Use

The structure should constrain the use of the API to make correct usage of the API easy and wrong usage of the API hard. Similarly, the intended use of the API should look correct and unintended use should look incorrect.

See [The Little Manual of API Design](#the-little-manual-of-api-design) Principle of "hard to misuse".

### Documentation

Documentation explains to the user how to effectively interact with the API.

Documentation generally:

* explains the __Technical Model__ employed,
* describes the __Mental Model__ the API represents,
* provides examples of correct usage, and
* catalogues available functionality.

Note: Available functionality can include API behavior limitations (such as performance) that are not captured by the structure.

#### Documentation Purpose

The purpose of documentation is to explain how to effectively interact with the API at both a higher and finer level.

#### Documentation Principles

##### Explain Concepts

Documentation can be used to explain the concepts required to use the API. Understanding the high-level concepts of the API can help others use the API more effectively.

Understanding "overall architecture" was cited as key need for developers to do more than the basics in [What Makes APIs Hard to Learn](#what-makes-apis-hard-to-learn).

##### Show Intent

Having documentation show intent, for example by providing examples of intended use, allows consumers of the API to model and constrain their usage to the intended uses.




## Conclusion

Model, Behavior, Structure, and Documentation can all work together to facilitate API accessibility.

Following the principles outlined for each concept can help transfer the desired model from the head of the author to that of the user and make an API more accessible.

```text
an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, communication protocols, and tools for building software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication among various components. A good API makes it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer.

> usable  APIs are  more  intuitive,  require  less  documentation  browsing,  and encourage reuse, thus increasing developers’ productivity

> cognitive dimensions: elements that characterize the expectations of users and what an API actually provides

> Finding descriptive, non-ambiguous names for API features is problematic given that programmers may be used to different terminologies.

> Discovering relations between API types (classes)  requires significant effort; simple designs are beneficial, especially to less experienced programmers.

> Accurate and complete documentation is a crucial issue for API usability; all the major usability flaws discovered in our study trace back to unsatisfactory documentation.

> Flexibility is a double-edged sword in API design: experienced programmers can take advantage of it, but it may confuse those with less practice

usability tokens - tokens are negatives in the API design

* surprise - API performs in a way that is not as the developer expected
* choice - requires understanding options slowing implementation
* missed - feature was there to aid implementation but developer did not see it
* incorrect - developer uses API incorrectly
* unexpected - API used in way not designed for

## Intent

The intent of this paper is to build a mental model of the purpose and pieces of an API in the readers mind.

Ideally the readers mind should come away shaped to think about API's as a way to share knowledge with others.

Calling out each aspect of the API is meant to encourage the reader to think about each aspect independently but also in context of the other aspects.

The principles are meant to guide thought by providing a place to start when designing an API. By no means are the principles exhaustive.

The references section with its summaries of material are meant to encourage the reader to do their own exploration of the topic.

Hope you enjoyed the paper! I hope to have a video up soon that explores the topic in a more dynamic way.
