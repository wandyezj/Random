# Class Structure

Thoughts on a class structure for a Class.

## Philosophy

You can't force someone to learn, you can only inspire them to reach the next level.

You should always be answering:
    why should students learn this material?
    why should students spend time on this class?

The class needs to capture students hearts and minds.

    Students must fall in love the class
    Students minds must be engaged with the class
    

## Learning methodology

Students learn in different ways so it's important to provide varied instruction methods to meet students learning strategies.

Simiarly different instruction methods solidify the course concepts.

## Per Week

two 10 minute lectures

one paper to read

one video to watch

one writing assignment

one discussion

one toe tipper

one personal quiz

one main assignment


## Two weeks

The programming assigments should come in pairs

one assignment to teach the fundamental concept

one assignment to extend and build on the concept

## Per class

There should always be an end of class student driven project where they can show off what they have learned.

## Total Time per weeks

The total time that students spend outside of class should amount to no more than five hours.
There should be three additional hours that are free for students to engage with the material that they are interested in. This means the instructor should prepare three additional hours of material that students can engage in at their interest. Students interests will be diverse so the material should be similarly diverse.
