### Spinal Ship mount

Have the weapon take up most of a ships space multiply the size of the weapon accordingly.
The weapon is essentially the ships entire weapon.

* Scale a weapon massively have it take up at least x10 space and maybe x15 space
* Ony available for direct fire weapons
* Increase range of the weapon slightly +2
* Increase the accuracy slightly +30 % (so much of the ship is devoted to the weapon, simply a counter to stealth armor)
* Decrease the rate of fire slightly. (double time it take to cool down)

Codes S and MS, only allow for battleships and dreadnoughts

x10 = 40 -> 400, 70 -> 700
x15 = 20 -> 300, 30->450,  40 -> 600, 50 -> 750, 70 -> 1050
